# Generative AI Learning Journal

Welcome to my **Generative AI Learning Journal**!  
This repository documents my learning journey through the [5-Day Gen AI Intensive Course with Google Learn Guide](https://www.kaggle.com/learn-guide/5-day-genai) and beyond.

## Why I Started This
I’m building my foundation in applied AI—especially Large Language Models (LLMs), prompt engineering, and tools like RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation).

I created this journal to:
- Stay consistent with daily learning
- Reflect on what I’ve learned
- Share insights with others who are on a similar journey
- Track progress as I grow more confident with Generative AI

## What You'll Find Here

Each day, I will document:
- **3 Key Learnings**: Core concepts or ideas from the day
- **2 Things I Practiced**: Hands-on exercises or tools I applied
- **1 Open Question**: Something I’m still curious or unsure about
- **My Summary**: A short reflection in my own words

Optional additions:
- Code snippets
- Screenshots
- Visual diagrams
- Links to related resources or papers
